  "gameBlurb": "In Bad Trip, you play as a desperate addict, driven by an unrelenting need for your next high. With no other options, you plan a heist at the local supermarket to fuel your habit. But this is no ordinary store-its halls are filled with unexpected obstacles, mind-bending puzzles, and eyes that seem to follow your every move. Sneak, solve, and survive as you make your way toward your goal... before your own mind becomes your greatest enemy. Can you hold it together long enough to make it out?"
